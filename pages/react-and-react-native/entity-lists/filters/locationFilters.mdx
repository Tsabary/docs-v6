### Location Filters

#### Overview
The Location Filters feature in Replyke allows you or your users to filter entities within a specified radius of a given geographic coordinate. This is particularly useful for applications that involve location-based content, such as local events, businesses, or nearby user posts. With Location Filters, users can narrow down their entity list (content feed) to display only entities relevant to a specific location.

#### How It Works
The `locationFilters` prop is used to define the geographic filter parameters. The filter expects an object of type `LocationFilters`, which contains the latitude, longitude, and radius (in meters) to define the area of interest.

```typescript
interface LocationFilters {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  radius: number;
}
```

This object can be provided to the `fetchEntities` function to apply location filtering. To dynamically adjust the location filters, call `fetchEntities` with the desired location configuration.

```typescript
entityList.fetchEntities({
  sortBy: "hot",
  locationFilters: { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194, radius: 5000 }
});
```

- Setting the filters to `null` removes the location-based filtering.
- Providing valid `latitude`, `longitude`, and `radius` values applies the filter.

#### Example Usage

To change the location filter dynamically, use the `fetchEntities` function:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const entityList = useEntityList({ listId: "filtered-feed" });

  const updateLocation = () => {
    entityList.fetchEntities({
      sortBy: "hot",
      locationFilters: {
        latitude: 40.7128,
        longitude: -74.0060,
        radius: 10000, // 10 km
      }
    });
  };

  const clearLocation = () => {
    entityList.fetchEntities({
      sortBy: "hot",
      locationFilters: null
    }); // Removes location filters
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={updateLocation}>Set New Location</button>
      <button onClick={clearLocation}>Clear Location Filters</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Notes
1. **Precision**: Ensure the latitude and longitude values are precise enough for the desired filtering. Slight inaccuracies in coordinates may result in unexpected results.
2. **Radius Limitations**: The radius value determines the size of the filtering area in meters. Be mindful of performance implications when using very large radii.
3. **No Location Filter**: If `locationFilters` is set to `null` in `fetchEntities`, the system will ignore location as a filtering criterion when fetching entities.

#### Conclusion
Location Filters provide a powerful way to enhance entity lists' relevance by focusing on geographic proximity. Whether used statically during initialization or dynamically via the `fetchEntities` function, this feature enables users to tailor their content feeds for a highly localized experience. Combine it with other filters like Keywords or Title Filters for even more precise content curation.
