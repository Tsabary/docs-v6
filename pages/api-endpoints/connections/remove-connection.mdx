- **Withdraw**: Only the requester can withdraw pending requests they sent
- **Disconnect**: Either party can remove established connections
- Deletes the connection record completely (allows fresh requests later)

- Alternative: Use `DELETE api.replyke.com/api/v6/:projectId/users/:userId/connection` when you know the user ID
- Rate limiting: 50 requests per 5 minutes
