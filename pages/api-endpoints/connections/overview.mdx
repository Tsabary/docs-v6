# Connection Operations

This section contains **connection-centric operations** for managing the logged in user's connection relationships. These endpoints focus on the logged in user's connection data, requests, and established connections.

## Purpose

Connection-centric endpoints allow developers to:
- Get lists of the logged in user's established connections
- Get the logged in user's connection counts
- Manage the logged in user's pending connection requests (sent and received)
- Accept or decline connection requests for the logged in user
- Remove specific connections by connection ID

## Key Characteristics

- **Logged in user focused**: Operations on the authenticated user's connection data
- **Authentication required**: All endpoints require user authentication
- **No userId parameter**: Uses authentication to identify the user
- **Request management**: Separate endpoints for sent vs received requests
- **Bidirectional relationships**: Connections require mutual agreement

## Available Operations

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/connections` | GET | List logged in user's established connections |
| `/connections/count` | GET | Get logged in user's connections count |
| `/connections/pending/sent` | GET | List requests logged in user sent (pending) |
| `/connections/pending/received` | GET | List requests logged in user received (pending) |
| `/connections/:connectionId/accept` | PUT | Accept a received request |
| `/connections/:connectionId/decline` | PUT | Decline a received request |
| `/connections/:connectionId` | DELETE | Remove connection/withdraw request |

## Examples

**Connection-centric operations** (use authentication, no userId parameter):
- "Get all logged in user's established connections" - uses auth token
- "Get pending requests sent by logged in user" - uses auth token

**User-centric operations** (target specific users):
- "Get all connections of user-123" - requires userId parameter
- "Send connection request to user-123" - requires userId parameter

## Connection Statuses

Connections have three possible statuses:
- **`pending`**: Request sent, awaiting response
- **`accepted`**: Connection established (bidirectional)
- **`declined`**: Request rejected

## Difference from User-Centric Operations

**Connection-centric** (`/connections/...`):
- Operates on the **logged in user's** connection data
- Uses authentication to identify the user
- No userId parameter needed

**User-centric** (`/users/:userId/connections/...`):
- Operates on a **specific user** by their ID
- Requires userId parameter in the URL
- Can target any user (including public data)
