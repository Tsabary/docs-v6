# User Follow Operations

This section contains **user-centric follow operations** where you interact with follows in the context of a specific user. These endpoints are designed for operations that target a particular user by their ID.

## Purpose

User-centric follow endpoints allow developers to:
- Follow or unfollow a specific user
- Check logged in user's follow status with a specific user
- View a specific user's followers and following lists
- Get follower/following counts for any user

## Key Characteristics

- **Target-focused**: Operations target a specific user by ID
- **Requires userId parameter**: All endpoints need a specific user ID in the URL
- **Mixed authentication**: Actions require auth, public data viewing may not
- **Specific relationship queries**: Focus on relationships with particular users

## Available Operations

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/users/:userId/follow` | POST | Follow a specific user |
| `/users/:userId/follow` | GET | Check if logged in user follows this user |
| `/users/:userId/follow` | DELETE | Unfollow a specific user |
| `/users/:userId/followers` | GET | Get user's followers list |
| `/users/:userId/followers-count` | GET | Get user's followers count |
| `/users/:userId/following` | GET | Get user's following list |
| `/users/:userId/following-count` | GET | Get user's following count |

## Examples

**User-centric operations** (target specific users, require userId parameter):
- "Follow user-123" - requires userId parameter
- "Check if logged in user follows user-456" - requires userId parameter

**Follow-centric operations** (logged in user's data, no userId parameter):
- "Get all accounts the logged in user follows" - uses auth token, no userId
- "Get logged in user's follower count" - uses auth token, no userId

## Difference from Follow-Centric Operations

**User-centric** (`/users/:userId/follows/...`):
- Operates on a **specific user** by their ID
- Requires userId parameter in the URL
- Can target any user (including public data)

**Follow-centric** (`/follows/...`):
- Operates on the **logged in user's** follow data
- Uses authentication to identify the user
- No userId parameter needed
